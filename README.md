## Reflection

Created Tall Grassland website after being tired of updating content in wordpress and also tired of paying someone else for a website that I could build on my own.<br />

Feeling the need to tackle React-Redux, this is the first project where I have implemented React-Redux. My knowledge has grown exponentially with this project, because every step needed further research inorder to overcome the task at hand. Something I felt was going to be straight forward like adding pictures, was not as easy as I thought, but I was able to incorporate react hooks and firebase storage. <br />

In the future I will come back to add a fullstack website with stripe integration. <br />






## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about running tests for more information.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`


Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!<br />

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at<br /> any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.<br /><br />

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies<br /> (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over <br />them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the<br /> copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.<br /><br />

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and<br /> middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we<br /> understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when<br /> you are ready for it.<br /><br />
